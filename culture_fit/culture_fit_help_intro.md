## How is national culture modeled and quantified?

[Geert Hofstede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Hofstede) was one of the most famous cross-cultural researchers in history. He was one of the first people to use significant research data to quantify national cultures. He, assisted by other collaboarators, proposed a model which measures a nation's culture in terms of 6 basic issues that a society needs to come to terms with in order to organize itself. These are called "dimensions of national culture." Each of them has been expressed on a scale that runs from 0 to 100.
