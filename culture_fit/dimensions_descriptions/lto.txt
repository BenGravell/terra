This dimension associates the connection of the past with current and future actions/challenges. A higher degree of this index (long-term) indicates that adaptation and circumstantial, pragmatic problem-solving are viewed as a necessity to be ready for the future, as the future is always changing. Long term oriented, or "flexhumble", societies have a dynamic mindset towards the future. Societies with a low degree in this index (short-term) look to the past to solve the problems they face in the present and to make decisions for the future. Stability and tradition are important to these short term oriented, or "monumentalist", societies, leading them to stick to conventions and to maintain a rather static and fixed mindset.
