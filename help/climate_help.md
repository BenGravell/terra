## What is Climate?

**Climate** is the long-term pattern of weather in a particular area.

Climate is an important consideration for people wishing to live in another country, for a few key reasons:
1. **Health and Comfort**: Certain climates are better suited for individuals with specific health issues. For example, people with respiratory problems might find dry climates more beneficial, while those with arthritis might prefer warmer locales. Furthermore, extreme weather conditions, be it excessive heat, cold, or humidity, can be uncomfortable for many.

2. **Lifestyle and Outdoor Activities**: Your preferred lifestyle and outdoor hobbies can be influenced by the climate. If you enjoy skiing, a country with a colder climate and mountainous regions might be more suitable. If you're a beach lover, a tropical or temperate coastal region might be your ideal choice.

3. **Infrastructure and Utility Costs**: Some climates require more robust infrastructure to handle conditions such as heavy snow or tropical storms. Similarly, heating costs in colder countries and cooling costs in hotter countries can significantly affect monthly expenses.

4. **Environmental Concerns**: With the ongoing effects of climate change, some regions are more vulnerable to sea-level rise, droughts, or other extreme weather events. It's essential to consider the long-term habitability of a place due to potential climate-induced changes.

5. **Adaptation Period**: Depending on your previous residence's climate, adapting to a new climate can take time. This can influence your initial experience in the new country.

Given the broad impact of climate on daily life, potential residents should evaluate how a country's climate aligns with their preferences, needs, and long-term plans before making a move.

## Where did the data come from?

The data was collected from the following sources:
- Country Temperatures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_yearly_temperature
    - Due to unusual variation for Denmark and Norway with inclusion of remote land holdings, the values were replaced with mean temperature from https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/denmark/climate-data-historical and https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/norway/climate-data-historical respectively.
- Sunshine Hours: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_by_sunshine_duration
