## What is the *Human Freedom Index*?

The *Human Freedom Index* presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. Human freedom is a social concept that recognizes the dignity of individuals and is defined here as negative liberty or the absence of coercive constraint. The *Human Freedom Index* is a resource that can help to more objectively observe relationships between freedom and other social and economic phenomena, as well as the ways in which the various dimensions of freedom interact with one another.


## What are the components of the *Human Freedom Index*?

The *Human Freedom Index* is made up of two high-level sub-indexes:
- *Personal Freedom*
    - Personal Freedom measures the degree to which members of a country are free to exercise civil liberties. This includes freedom of movement, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and political action, freedom of the press and information, and freedom to engage in various interpersonal relationships. This also includes the rule of law, security, and safety, which are necessary for meaningful exercise of personal freedoms.
- *Economic Freedom*
    - Economic Freedom measures the degree to which members of a country are free to exercise financial liberties. This includes the freedom to trade, the freedom to use sound money. This also includes the size of government, legal system and property rights, and market regulation, which are necessary for meaningful exercise of economic freedoms.


## Who created these indexes?

The report is copublished by the Cato Institute and the Fraser Institute.

## Criticism

The Cato Institute and the Fraser Institute have significant, self-declared libertarian-conservative leanings, origins, and purposes.

The *Economic Freedom Index* in particular has been criticized as being misleading, both by [individual observers](https://erlendkulanderkvitrud.medium.com/the-economic-freedom-index-is-a-steaming-pile-of-neoliberal-bullshit-a35205855e29) and the liberal democratic think-tank [Niskanen Center](https://www.niskanencenter.org/elusive-regulatory-state/), due to the inclusion of economic outcomes in the index, which has the effect of incresasing correlation between economic liberty and prosperity by construction. 

The *Economic Freedom Index* has also been criticized by the [International Labour Organization](https://www.ilo.org/) in the 2014 report "Comparing indicators of labour market regulations across databases: A post scriptum to the employing workers debate"(https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---travail/documents/publication/wcms_245349.pdf) for "containing a strong conceptual bias. They view labour institutions and regulations as a cost to business that reduces efficiency and competitiveness, and do not attempt to recognize the social objectives of labour regulations or some potential benefits to the employer."
