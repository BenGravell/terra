## What is the *Human Freedom Index*?

The *Human Freedom Index* presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. Human freedom is a social concept that recognizes the dignity of individuals and is defined here as negative liberty or the absence of coercive constraint. Because freedom is inherently valuable and plays a role in human progress, it is worth measuring carefully. The *Human Freedom Index* is a resource that can help to more objectively observe relationships between freedom and other social and economic phenomena, as well as the ways in which the various dimensions of freedom interact with one another.


## What are the *Personal Freedom Index* and *Economic Freedom Index*?

The *Human Freedom Index* is broken into two high-level sub-indexes:
- *Personal Freedom*
    - Personal Freedom measures the degree to which members of a country are free to exercise civil liberties. This includes freedom of movement, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly and political action, freedom of the press and information, and freedom to engage in various interpersonal relationships. This also includes the rule of law, security, and safety, which are necessary for meaningful exercise of personal freedoms.
- *Economic Freedom*
    - Economic Freedom measures the degree to which members of a country are free to exercise financial liberties. This includes the freedom to trade, the freedom to use sound money. This also includes the size of government, legal system and property rights, and market regulation, which are necessary for meaningful exercise of economic freedoms.
