## What is the *Happy Planet Index*?

The *Happy Planet Index* is a measure of sustainable wellbeing, ranking countries by how efficiently they deliver long, happy lives using our limited environmental resources. The *Happy Planet Index* helps to answer the question: “Is it possible to live good lives without costing the Earth?”


## What are the components of the *Happy Planet Index*?

The *Happy Planet Index* is computed from three high-level sub-indexes:
- *Life Expectancy*
    - The average number of years an infant born in that country is expected to live if prevailing patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of birth in the country stay the same throughout the infant’s life. 
    - Life expectancy is commonly used as an overall indicator of the standard of health in a country.
- *Experienced Wellbeing*
    - The average of all responses from within the population to the following question: “Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top. Suppose we say that the top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you; and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder do you feel you personally stand at the present time, assuming that the higher the step the better you feel about your life, and the lower the step the worse you feel about it? Which step comes closest to the way you feel?”
    - This measure of wellbeing, the ‘Ladder of Life’ is commonly used as an indicator of how people’s lives are going overall.
- *Ecological Footprint*
    - The average amount of land needed, per head of population, to sustain a country’s typical consumption patterns.
    - It includes the land required to provide the renewable resources people use (most importantly food and wood products), the area occupied by infrastructure, and the area required to absorb CO2 emissions. Crucially it is a measure of consumption, not production. This means that, for example, the  CO associated with the manufacture of a mobile phone made in South Korea but bought by someone living in Kuwait, will count towards Kuwait’s Ecological Footprint, not South Korea’s. Ecological Footprint is expressed using a standardised unit: global hectares. A global hectare (gha) is a biologically productive hectare with world average productivity in a given year. 

These three sub-indexes are combined using a formula described in detail in the [Happy Planet Index 2021 Methodology Paper](https://happyplanetindex.org/wp-content/themes/hpi/public/downloads/happy-planet-index-methodology-paper.pdf).


## Who created these indexes?

The Happy Planet Index has been produced by various organizations at various times:
- 2023: [The Hot or Cool Institute](https://hotorcool.org/)
- 2019-2023: [The Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll)](http://www.weall.org/)
- 2006-2019: [The New Economics Foundation (NEF)](http://www.neweconomics.org/)

These organizations generally have a left-leaning bent and are concerned with achieving social and ecological justice aims.
