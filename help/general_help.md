## What is this?

This app is designed to answer the question *"which country should I live in?"*

Use data to decide which country is right for you. Terra will take your personal preferences regarding Culture Fit, Human Freedom, and Language into account and recommend one or more countries that match.


## Provenance

This app is partially based off of Michal Nowotka's tutorial ([Blog](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-make-a-culture-map/)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-culture-map)), which is partially used (with modifications).


## Caveats and Limitations

This app integrates several data sources, which do not have complete information for every country. Therefore, some countries will be excluded from the analysis. Please contact the app author if you have more complete data to share.
