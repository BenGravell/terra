## What is the *Social Progress Index*?

The *Social Progress Index* rigorously measures country performance on many aspects of social and environmental performance which are relevant for countries at all levels of economic development. The index gives governments and businesses the tools to track social and environmental performance rigorously, and make better public policy and investment choices. The *Social Progress Index* also allows us to assess a country's success in turning economic progress into improved social outcomes.

## What are the components of the *Social Progress Index*?

The *Social Progress Index* is made up of three high-level sub-indexes:
- *Basic Human Needs*
    - Basic Human Needs measures the capacity of a society to meet the basic human needs of its citizens.
    - This includes access to nutrition and basic medical care, water and sanitation, shelter, and personal safety.
- *Foundations of Wellbeing*
    - Foundations of Wellbeing measures the capacity of a society to establish the building blocks that allow citizens and communities to enhance and sustain the quality of their lives.
    - This includes access to basic knowledge via primary and secondary education, access to information and communication, health and wellness, and environmental quality.
- *Opportunity*
    - Opportunity measures the capacity of a society to create the conditions for all individuals to reach their full potential.
    - This includes personal rights, personal freedoms, inclusiveness (especially as it relates to marginalized groups), and access to advanced education.

## Who created these indexes?

The report is published by the [Social Progress Imperative](https://www.socialprogress.org/), based on the writings of Amartya Sen, Douglass North, and Joseph Stiglitz.

This organization is somewhat centrist politically.


## Criticism

The index's measure of good governance has been criticized for using data biased against the Global South, and some critics have noted that much of the criteria are based on European values. There has also been debate on the relevance or accuracy of many of the measurements for gender equality.
