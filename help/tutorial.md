    - `Selected Country Details` gives details about the single selected country.
        - Browse the `CIA World Factbook` page for the country for summary information.
        - Open `Google Maps` centered on the country to get a feel for the geography.
    - `Score Distributions` shows how each score is distributed across all countries.
    - `Score Contributions` shows a breakdown of the contribution of each component to the Overall Score.
