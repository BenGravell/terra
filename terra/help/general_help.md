## Provenance

The **Culture Fit** portion of this app is largely based off of Michal Nowotka's tutorial ([Blog](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-make-a-culture-map/)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-culture-map)), which is partially used (with modifications).


## Caveats and Limitations

This app integrates several data sources, which do not have complete information for every country. Therefore, some countries will be excluded from the analysis. Please contact the app author if you have more complete data to share.

Furthermore, even the data that are present are not free from all bias and are subject to valid criticism. Such criticsm is elaborated in each section.


## Desktop vs Mobile Usage

For the best experience, use Terra from a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari on a desktop or laptop. Terra can be used from mobile devices, but some user interface elements may not be as easy to use.
