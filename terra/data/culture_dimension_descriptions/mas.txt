In this dimension, masculinity is defined as "a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness and material rewards for success." Its counterpart, femininity, represents "a preference for cooperation, modesty, caring for the weak and quality of life." Women in the respective societies tend to display different values. In feminine societies, women share modest and caring views equally with men. In masculine societies, women are somewhat assertive and competitive, but notably less than men. In other words, they still recognize a gap between male and female values.
